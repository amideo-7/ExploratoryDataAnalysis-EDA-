# ExploratoryDataAnalysis-EDA-
In this project, we embark on a journey of exploration and discovery through the realm of data. Our goal is to unravel hidden patterns, trends, and insights that lie within a rich and diverse dataset, using the powerful technique of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). By employing a combination of statistical methods, data visualization, and domain knowledge, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data and extract meaningful information to inform decision-making processes.

## What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data science process. It is a systematic approach to understanding the data, identifying patterns, and generating hypotheses. EDA can be used with any type of data, but it is particularly useful for large and complex datasets.

The goal of EDA is to gain a better understanding of the data. This understanding can be used to inform the next steps in the data science process, such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building.


*There are many different techniques that can be used for EDA. Some of the most common include:*

- ***Univariate analysis***: This involves examining each variable in the dataset individually. This can be done by looking at the distribution of the data, identifying outliers, and calculating summary statistics.

- ***Bivariate analysis***: This involves examining the relationships between two variables. This can be done by creating scatterplots, calculating correlation coefficients, and performing hypothesis tests.

- ***Multivariate analysis***: This involves examining the relationships between multiple variables. This can be done by creating heatmaps, calculating cluster analysis, and performing principal component analysis.
